5. Overview

This specification describes the Falcon protocol that provides reliable transport for RDMA Operations and NVMe commands. Falcon is a connection-oriented, request-response transport protocol that provides end-to-end reliable transfer and per-connection security to upper layer protocols (ULPs) such as RDMA and NVMe. A Falcon connection can either be ordered or unordered. Falcon includes a programmable congestion control engine that can be used to implement state-of-the-art congestion control algorithms. Falcon authenticates and encrypts all ULP data on a per-connection basis using the Paddywhack Security Protocol (PSP) or the IPSEC ESP protocol. The following sections describe key architectural concepts of Falcon in further detail.
